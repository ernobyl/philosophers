# Philosophers
## About the project
  This project is an implementation of the dining philosophers problem using the pthreads library in C.
  Philosophers sit at a round table and do one of three things: eat, sleep, or think. While eating, they need two forks (one from their left and one from their right).
  The challenge is to avoid deadlock and make sure no philosopher starves.
